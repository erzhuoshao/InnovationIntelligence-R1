The fruit is coupled by means of suction attachment to a first conveyor and carried to a position wherein the opposing side of the fruit is suction coupled to the second conveyor. The fruit is drawn through a halving guillotine and coring blade. The fruit halves are then positioned on scooping and sectioning assemblies. A rotating semicircular hoop blade cuts the fruit meat away from the peel while leaving the fruit meat and peel in place. The separated peel and fruit meat are moved across the scooping and sectioning assembly through a blade assembly which sections the fruit meat. The meat sectioning blade has a first portion which cuts through the peel and fruit meat to establish a first radial extent of the section cut. A following portion of the same blade is provided with a dull edge which completes the section cut of the fruit meat, but is not sharp enough to cut the peel or to cut any portion of the conveyor. The conveyor retains uninterrupted suction attachment with the partially sliced fruit peel and is undamaged by the suctioning blade(s). The fruit meat sections then fall away from the peel, which latter is moved by the conveyor to a disposal position. \\n'}, 'score': 443.0078125}, {'document': {'id': '10228227', 'contents': 'Patent ID: 10228227\\nTitle: Scale\\nDate: 2019-03-12\\nType: utility (Kind: B2)\\nNumber of Claims: 6\\n\\nAbstract:\\nIn a scale constituted by a plurality of scale lines, to provide such a scale capable of easily reading scale values.

One or more methods of analysis of historical data, in a hierarchical manner, determine events which led to an observed outcome. The outcome-based algorithms use, as input, a future event or state and generate attributes that are necessary precursors. By creating these attributes, the future can be affected. Where necessary, synthetic contributors of such attributes are also created and made to act in ways consistent with generating the assumed outcome.
